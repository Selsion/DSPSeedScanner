# DSPSeedScanner
This github repo contains seed lists for the game [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/) produced from my standalone seed scanner. The different lists are provided as files in this repo, and are described below.

The code for the seed scanner is currently not included in this repo, since it uses decompiled code from the game. No executable is available for public use yet, since configuration is currently done by modifying the code. The scanner may in the far future be changed to not rely on using decompiled code, if such a scanner proves to not be too difficult to make. If the scanner ever reaches that stage, then its code will be shared on this repo, and proper user configuration will be added.

## Seed lists
- [3bg.csv](https://github.com/Selsion/DSPSeedScanner/blob/main/seed_lists/3bg.csv): All 435383 64-star seeds with 3 blue giants (3 is the max). Each line contains the seed, followed by the 3 blue giants' luminosities sorted from greatest to smallest. Formatted as a csv to allow importing into spreadsheet software


## Todo
Add the other seed lists
